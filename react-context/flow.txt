PROLOGUE
It was a dark and stormy night,
The server is hosted in ./server/index.js, and ran with npm run dev
Webpack + Babel transpiles multiple JSX files from /client into public/main.js
Using the middleware of express.static, './public/' is served to client
User connects to the server through the browser, sending a get request to index.html.
The client runs main.js, which starts with the contents of (pre-build) index.js
Index.jsx calls the ReactDOM.createRoot on "div#root" from index.html
Index.jsx renders the App Component on the root div, (from ./public/app.jsx)
The app constructor run, setting 3 state variables and this-binding 2 methods
The app component when rendered() returns
  components <Navbar /> and <PageContainer /> wrapped with a context provider
  the context provider has a value prop with an object contextValue containing:
    two values destructured from this.state, user and route
    two methods destructured from this, handleSignIn(), handleSignOut()
Inside <PageContainer />, depending on the value of route.path from state
  It returns one of three components: <Home />, <Auth />, or <NotFound />

CH 1 User can sign up.
CH 2 User can sign in.
CH 3 User can stay signed in.
CH 4 User can sign out.
